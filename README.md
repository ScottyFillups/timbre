WebRTC [demo](https://timbrejs.herokuapp.com); click "generate" to get a URL. Sharing it with another person will initiate an audio/video call. Arbitrary data can be sent over too using WebRTC; typing text in the box and clicking "post" will send the text over, similar to a socket bi-directional implementation.
